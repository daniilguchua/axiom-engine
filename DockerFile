# 1. Use a lightweight Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy dependency file to the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install dependencies
# (We add --no-cache-dir to keep the image small)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy the rest of your code to the container
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# 7. Define the command to run the app
# We use 'gunicorn' for production stability instead of 'python app.py'
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
